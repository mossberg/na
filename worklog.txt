## 2/8

- starting this dumb memory allocator bc i don't know how to write them.
  though it might be fun to try to write it organically rather than looking up
  how to do it
- first one is going to be so dumb. will only support alloc(). no realloc, free
  etc
- api
    - init
        - mmaps region
    - alloc
        - return memory
    - close
        - munmap
- allocator will have state. basically just a pointer to the start of the
  free section. that pointer will get bumped on every malloc call. how to
  check if we've exceeded pagesize space?
    - well i guess we can keep a total allocated state variable and check that
      on every alloc.
    - or just in the init, save the address of the last valid address of the
      mapping and compare that. i'll do this
